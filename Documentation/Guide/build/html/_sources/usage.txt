Usage
=====

Just use your web application as normal. To browse profiling reports, go to ``http://yourhost/profiler/``.

For each run, the profiler collects the following data:

- meta-information for the current run (like: the context the request was invoked in, the controller being used)
- timers which can be started and stopped, measuring the details of the application flow.
- the full XHProf profile, containing the (almost) complete call-graph of the run. This is only enabled
  if XHProf is installed.

Overview Page
-------------

The overview page is the main entry point to the profiler. It shows the different
profiling runs. For each profiling run, it can display overview information
like the number of created objects or the memory consumption. Each of the
columns of the table is called a *dimension*.

On top, the bar charts show how the values in a given dimension are distributed,
and allow you to filter the different dimensions to the wanted values.

You can easily create your own dimensions; how to do that is explained later.

Timeline Page
-------------

The timeline page gives a visual overview of a request, showing the timers
of the request, and how memory consumption changed.

XHProf Page
-----------

You can also drill down to the XHProf page, showing the detailed statistics
of the run.


Configuring Custom Dimensions
-----------------------------

The available dimensions are configured inside the ``Settings.yaml`` and that's
also how you can add new dimensions.

Let's check how the default dimensions work:

.. code-block:: yaml

	Sandstorm:
	  Plumber:
	    calculations:
	      methodCallsOnObject:
	        label: 'No. of Method Calls'
	        type: regexSum
	        regex: '#==>(.*)::.*#'
	      totalRuntime:
	        label: 'Runtime (ms)'
	        type: timerSum
	        timerName: 'Profiling Run'
	      totalMemory:
	        label: 'Memory (kb)'
	        type: maxMemory

It defines three dimensions, and gives each of them a label. Each dimension has
a ``type`` which specifies how the data inside this dimension is aggregated.

We support the following types:

maxMemory
~~~~~~~~~

**Parameters:** None

Output the maximum memory which has been used in kilobytes.

totalRuntime
~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Parameters:** ``timerName``

This one sums up the total runtime in milliseconds of a timer specified by ``timerName``.

regexSum
~~~~~~~~

**Parameters:** ``regex``

This is the most versatile counter. **It needs XHProf to be installed**, else it
does not work.

It counts the number of method invocations in an XHProf trace. To know how the ``regex``
parameter works, we need to check how an XHProf trace is built:

An XHProf trace is a big array with elements like the following::

	'Sandstorm\PhpProfiler\Domain\Model\ProfilingRun::startTimer==>microtime' (76) => array(2)
	   'ct' (2) => integer 10
	   'wt' (2) => integer 9

This means: "From inside the method ``startTime`` in ``ProfilingRun`` the function ``microtime`` has been called
10 times. All these calls to microtime together needed 9 milliseconds."

.. note:: I'm currently not sure about the time scale, whether it's micro- or milliseconds...

Now, the ``regexSum`` loops over such a trace, and if the regex matches the array key,
it counts the number of calls together.

As an example, let's demonstrate that with some regexes:

.. code-block:: text

	#==>.*__construct#              Matches all constructor invocations
	#==>.*TextNode::__construct#    Matches all constructor invocations of classes which end with TextNode

	#.*#                            Matches all method calls
	#.*==>Doctrine\\Common.*::__construct#'
	                                Matches all object creations inside the Doctrine\Common package

Furthermore, the regex might contain exactly one submatch pattern. In this case, a popover is displayed
with the top 10 invocations grouped by the regex. Example:

.. code-block:: text

	#==>(.*)::__construct#                Matches all constructor invocations, displaying a Top 10 list of constructor invocations
	#==>TYPO3\\Fluid\\(.*)::__construct#  Matches constructor invocations in Fluid, displaying a Top 10 list of constructor invocations inside the fluid package

Custom types are currently not possible.
